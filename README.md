# Using Node for Cloud Stuff

Over the last week, I've created a lot of processes that can be used to move data around with node.

Learning how some of these processes work was not always immediately intuitive, but a lot of practice with Javascript helped.

This repo is designed to make it clear how to make use of Node for each possible use case.

A lot of the repositories I made recently involved large chunks of copying something from one I had already done.

Finding that example is not always straightforward, so I want to collect every example of everything you might want to do with Node, explain the entire setup, and help people pick this up as quickly as possible, should they want to.

Any feedback is very much appreciated. If there's something you want adding, say so.

Let me know if you want help with any problems in particular, I will be more than happy to help.

Regards,

Mark
